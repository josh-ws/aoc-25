## Quick Start

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Each puzzle has its own folder in the `puzzles/` subdirectory. Simply run

```bash
bun run puzzles/01/index.ts
```

Replacing `01` with the puzzle to run.

## Dev

Create a new folder in the `puzzles` subdirectory, using `template` as a guide.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.0. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
